WHAT IS TYPESCRIPT
    - TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning that it does everything that JavaScript does, but with some added features.
    - The main reason for using TypeScript is to add static typing to JavaScript. 
    - Static typing means that the type of a variable cannot be changed at any point in a program. It can prevent a LOT of bugs!
    - JavaScript is a dynamically typed lanaguage meaning variables can change their type. 
        - Example: 
        // JavaScript
        let daphne = 'Hello, world'
        daphne = 25 // daphne has changed from a string to a number which is a no  problem 
        - Where as TypeScript
        let daphne = 'Hello, world'
        daphne = 25 // Error: daphne cannot be changed from a string to number 
    - TypeScript cannot be understood by browsers so it is complied to JavaScript.

Why use TypeScript instead?
    - TypeScript can spot 15% of common bugs.
    - Readability – it is easier to see what the code it supposed to do. And when working in a team, it is easier to see what the other developers intended to
Drawbacks - TypeScript has to be compiled – which can take time, especially in larger projects.


Compile Typescript 
    - Write a typescript file like index.ts
    - In the terminal type tsc with the file name i.e tsc index
    - It will compile a js file called index.js
    - Towatch for changes and compile automatically 
        - tsc index.ts-w

TS config file 
    - The ts config file should be in the root directory of your project
    - In this file we can specify the root files, compiler options, and how strict we want TypeScript to be in checking our project.
    - To create a ts config file 
        - tsc --init
